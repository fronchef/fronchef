### **Contribution Guide**

#### Step 1: **Create Your Component**  
- Develop your component in a separate repository or folder.  
- Deploy it live using **GitHub Pages** or **Vercel** for demonstration purposes.

#### Step 2: **Fork the Fronchef Repository**  
- Navigate to the [Fronchef GitHub Repository](#) and click on `Fork`.

#### Step 3: **Clone the Repository**  
- Clone the repository to your local machine using:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/fronchef/fronchef.git
  ```
  Or download the ZIP file.

#### Step 4: **Add Your Component to Fronchef**  
- Navigate to the folder where components are stored:  
  ```bash
  cd components/render
  ```
- Go to the directory for your framework. For example, for React components:  
  ```bash
  cd components/render/reactRen
  ```
- Create a new folder named `id[n+1]` for your component (replace `[n+1]` with the next ID).  
- Add two mandatory files to this folder:  
  1. `Component.js`: Contains your component code.  
  2. `Bundle.tsx`: Defines your component's metadata with this structure:  
     ```typescript
     export const CodeSnippetBundle = {
         code: "", // Your component in string format
         SrcCode: [
             { name: "", code: "" }, // Helper components
         ],
         Modifications: [
             { name: "", code: "" }, // Global modifications
         ],
         dependencies: [], // List of dependencies
         message: [], // Optional messages
     };
     ```

  2. Your `Bundle.tsx` will look like this after completion:

#### Step 5: **Prepare Images**  
- Navigate to:  
  ```bash
  src/comp-images/react/id[n+1]
  ```
- Add **thumbnail** and **overview images** for your component.

#### Step 6: **Update Component Metadata**  
- Open the file:  
  ```bash
  src/constant/reactComp.ts
  ```
- Add details about your component, including the thumbnail, overview, and bundle.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Added new component"
  git push origin main
  ```

#### Step 8: **Submit a Pull Request**  
- Go to the original Fronchef repository and create a Pull Request (PR).  
- Add a meaningful description of your contribution.

#### Step 9: **Review and Merge**
